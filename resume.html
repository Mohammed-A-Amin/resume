        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class = "abouttext">My name is Mohammed Amin, I'm 15 years old I like to play videogames, travel, enjoy the outdoors, code, and design.
            I consider myself a hard worker that never gives up no matter what the challenge it. I always try to keep my motivation up
            no matter what I'm doing so I can get my tasks done. Fun fact about me is that in 2018, I travelled to different countries in Europe
            at once. I travelled to England, Scotland, France, and Germany. It was a very fun experience and I hope to become successful in life
            so I can travel to many other countries. I play games such as VALORANT, Minecraft, Hades, Terraria, and many more. If I had one word
            to describe me, it'd be curious because I'm interested in different types of things to be my passion and I'm still searching for it.
            I want to make sure that I achieve my dreams with strength and determination. This wouldn't be possible with the help
            of my friends and family. Through SEALS, I want to sharpen these skills to help better prepare me for what there is to come.

        <h3 >My Goals </h3>
        <p> I'm striving to become an engineer in the future.I'm mostly interested in robotics because
           of my experience programming robots in middle school and it's always been in my mind since.
           The thought of robots almost being able to think like humans with Artifical Intelligence is just
           fascinating to me, with my experience in looking at and programming these robots. My plan is to go to a 
           4 year university and study engineering, yet I'm still debating on what I want to do, so I'll really need to
          think about it before I can truly pursue what I want to do. I want to be able to find what I'm really passionate
        about so I can have it as my dream job. </p>

      <h3>Experience</h3>
      <p>I have plenty experience as a developer from SCLA. Every day during the program, I'd spend 10-12
          hours trying to code my app for my team, and it was very challenging. Through hard work and motivation,
          I was able to create an app called "CleanStream". The purpose of this app was to bring teens and young adults
          together to clean up the community. I also was in SOCAL NOMA Architecture Bootcamp to learn more about 
          Architecture and I was able to design my own buildings for a project for Metro. I also attended USC Viterbi's Engineering
          Bootcamp to learn about different kinds of Engineering. I was also in the MESA program and I entered competetions for bridge
          building.
